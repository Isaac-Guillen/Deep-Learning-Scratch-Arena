# Deep-Learning-Scratch-Implementations

## Why Scratch Implemantation??

The God Father of AI Geoffrey Hinton said "If you want to understand a really complicated device like brain, then you should build one".

Same goes for the Deep Learning technologies that exists currently. If you want to understand such technologies then you should implement them from scratch. Indeed Keras exists, but these kind of frameworks which takes not more than 5 lines to build a model actually hides everything from you, that makes you completely unknown what's going on under the hood. If you already understand the technology, then be my guest, otherwise if you are a beginner in the field......... you better listen to The God Father.

## Future plans?

More scratch implementations like autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoder..... are comping soon.
Also scratch implentations in Pytorch and Tensorflow are on their way.
